Simple Shell Project For ALx
Ismail Ismail, HENOK ASSEFA
Simple Shell UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
After receiving a command, shellex tokenizes it into words using " " as a delimiter. The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command. shellex then proceeds with the following actions:

If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\) nor dot (.), the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If there exists a builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
If the first character of the command is none of a slash (\), dot (.), nor builtin, shellex searches each element of the PATH environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
If the first character of the command is a slash (\) or dot (.) or either of the above searches was successful, the shell executes the named program with any remaining given arguments in a separate execution environment.
Output
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
